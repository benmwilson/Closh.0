#### Project Outline

The goal of this project is to implement a simple shell in C, which will require the use of
system calls directly. Using system calls like fork and exec, we have implemented a command-line shell like Bash. 
Closh.0, (aka Clone Shell Zero), is a simple shell-like program designed to run multiple copies of a program at once.
