#### Project Outline

The goal of this project is to implement a simple shell in C, which will require the use of
system calls directly. Using system calls like fork and exec, we have implemented a command-line shell like Bash. 
Closh.0, (aka Clone in the Shell Zero), is a simple shell-like program designed to run multiple copies of a program at once. 


#### Design Choices

When designing this program, we chose to first tackle the sequential execution prior to attempting the parallel portion. Once the sequential process was fleshed out and working, we we're able to tackle the parallel portion and implement some of the sequential logic to do so. We struggled to implement the timeout functionality using regular clocks, but eventually got it working thanks to a helpful guide that explained how to use SIGALRM and the alarm function properly. We stored our signal handler, aptly named the terminator, outside of any loops or functions to ensure it could be shared and accessed by both the parallel and sequential executions.


#### Features
The features included in this project are creating new processes, having the processes run either in parallel or sequentially,
 and timing out the processes. 
 
* The creating new processes feature takes an integer from 1 to 9 from the user, then creates a loop that that runsthe amount of times that the user specified. In each iteration of the loop the fork() method is called to create a child process which is just a copy of the parent process. In each iteration, in the child process that was just created, we call execvp() to replace the current program (what the parent process is currently running) with a new program that the user has specified.

* The program also asks the user if they want the processes to run in parallel or sequentially. 
  * If the program is running sequentially a waitpid() must called. This causes the parent process to wait for the child process that was just forked to finish before the parent process can continue. This makes the child processes run sequentially. 
  * For the paralallel code, the lack of a waitpid() call or a waitpid() call with the parameter of WNOHANG will cause the parent process to continue without waiting for the child process to finish which causes the parent and all the children processes to run in parallel.

*  The user produces a timeout value. If the time elapsed of the child process is greater than the timeout value then the parent kills the child process.

As a group, we decided to each attempt to tackle the project individually and try out our own different implementations. We eached coded out a parallel and sequential execution and then worked together to pick the best algorithm and make any suitable changes or fixes. The final code is the result of equal effort on the behalf of all group members, not one individual effort.
